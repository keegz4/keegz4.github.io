# Project 2 - User Page - Code Portfolio

We are creating both a user page and a project page on github.com during this project. It is exciting to see the different methods we are using to do these tasks. I am excited to see the outcome.

Throughout the term we have worked on some awesome projects and it has been very fun to learn how to do all of these things. We have put all of these things together in what is called a Code Portfolio. This is my Code Portfolio.

Here are some of the fun things that we have been able to create this term:

## [P2 Project page](https://uo-cit.github.io/p2-17S-keegz4/)

## [P3 Project Page](https://uo-cit.github.io/p3-17s-keegz4/)

## [P4 Project Page](https://uo-cit.github.io/p4-17s-keegz4/)
